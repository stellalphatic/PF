# Programming Fundamentals (PF)

This repository contains solutions to programming problems and tasks that I completed during my first semester at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET). The exercises are implemented in C++ and cover various fundamental programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **PD/**: Contains problem solutions for all tasks of Programming days.
- **PF/**: Includes the C++ source code files for each solved problem of PF Lab.

## Contents

The problems and tasks cover topics such as:

- Basic syntax and structure of C++ programs
- Control flow statements (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular programming
- Data structures like arrays and pointers
- File handling

Each solution is accompanied by comments explaining the logic and approach used. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions.

## Getting Started

To run the programs locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stellalphatic/PF.git
